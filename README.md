I completed the  challenge with HTML and CSS only. It is one of my first steps into the world of web development. I learned a lot, but i feel like there are things I can improve in code, especially in CSS code, because the footer bothered to get on top of the main content when the height of the body was small. 

I do not have much experience yet, but i am so interested in learn all fullstack technologies.

### Built With
